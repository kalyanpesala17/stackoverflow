# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

What are the most important things to look when you are applying for a job?     
What are the essential skills that recruiters are looking for?    
Outside of formal education, What other education types gave an edge to developers?         
What do developers prefer, Tabs or spaces?

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@kalyanpesala17/how-to-get-a-job-as-a-developer-3397d48994f0?source=friends_link&sk=216c49e12efad022618267243421281a)
